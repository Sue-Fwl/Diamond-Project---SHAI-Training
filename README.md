# Diamond-Project---SHAI-Training
A coursework project for predicting the prices of diamonds, and competing in it's related Kaggle competition with the model with the lowest RMSE outcome

### Context
This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization.


Description:

price price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x length in mm (0--10.74)

y width in mm (0--58.9)

z depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

### Files
train.csv - the training set (Available on Kaggle's competition "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/shai-ml/" )
test.csv - the test set (Available on Kaggle's competition "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/shai-ml/" )

Model1 - model #1 with the lowest RMSE, that got into top15 places in the Kaggle competition "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/shai-ml/"
Model2 - model #2, where we tested features permutations, and got 2nd best outcome with the least number of features.
Model3 - model #3, first model built.
Presentation - the presentation we prepared for the judging.
EDA - Exploratory data analysis file of the Diamond Prediction data.
